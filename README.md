# Warden 🦉  
*A Pathfinder 1E community experiment for Discord*

Warden is an **AI-enhanced Discord bot and web portal** built for **Pathfinder 1E** campaigns.  
Its goal is to help bridge **PathCompanion character sheets** with **Discord gameplay**, inspired by what **Avrae** does for D&D 5E — but for Pathfinder.

This project is **very much a work in progress**. I’m new to building systems like this, and Warden exists because I wanted to learn, experiment, and build something useful *with* the community, not perfectly *for* it.

If you’re expecting a finished product: this isn’t that.  
If you’re curious, patient, and willing to help break things: welcome.

## What Warden Does (Right Now)

Warden currently focuses on **Discord-first interaction**, including:

- Natural language dice rolling for Pathfinder-style checks
- Character proxying in Discord
- Integration groundwork for PathCompanion character data
- Command-based gameplay helpers for PF1E

You can see the **currently implemented commands here**:  
👉 `DISCORD_COMMANDS_PUBLIC.md`

## What Warden *Does Not* Do (Yet)

Some features are **planned or experimental**, but **not implemented**:

- Relationship graphs  
- Automated character sheet syncing  
- Persistent lore tracking  
- Full campaign state management  

Those ideas exist because they’re interesting — not because they’re finished.

## Why This Exists

Pathfinder 1E doesn’t have the same Discord tooling ecosystem as 5E.  
Warden is an attempt to explore what’s possible when:

- Character sheets live on the web  
- Gameplay lives in Discord  
- Automation helps without replacing the GM  

This is also a **learning project**. Mistakes will happen. Things will break. That’s expected.

## 🚧 Beta Testers Wanted

This is the most important part.

I need **beta testers** who are willing to:
- Use Warden in real games
- Tell me when things break
- Explain *how* they broke
- Share confusion, friction, or weird behavior

You do **not** need to be a developer.  
You do need patience and a tolerance for bugs.

## Join the Beta / Community Discord

If you’re interested in helping test Warden, give feedback, or just watch it evolve:

👉 **Join the Discord:** https://discord.gg/aNTNZkFQ

That’s where:
- Beta testing happens
- Bugs are reported
- Changes are discussed
- Features are argued about (politely)

---

## Final Notes

Warden is a **community experiment**, not a product.  
If it becomes useful, that’s a win.  
If it teaches me (and others) something, that’s also a win.

Thanks for taking a look — and extra thanks if you help test it.
