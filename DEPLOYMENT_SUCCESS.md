- **Branch:** main
- **Status:** ✅ Successfully deployed

## What Was Pushed

✅ 53 files committed
✅ All source code
✅ Configuration files
✅ Database migrations
✅ Documentation
✅ Pre-commit security hooks
❌ `.env` (protected - not committed)
❌ Credentials (all removed from docs)

## Security Note

GitHub's push protection caught a Discord bot token in the documentation during the first push attempt. This is **excellent** - it shows both layers of security are working:

1. ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** - Local protection
2. ✅ **GitHub secret scanning** - Remote protection

The token was removed from the documentation and the push succeeded.

## Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The bot will connect to:
- ✅ Neon PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Discord with your bot token
- ✅ Google Gemini AI
